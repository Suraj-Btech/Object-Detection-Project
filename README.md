# Object Detection Using YOLO

This is a beginner-friendly project to perform object detection using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm.  
The project is developed and run on **Google Colab**, making it easy to get started without installing anything on your system.

##  What is This Project About?

Object detection is a computer vision technique to locate and classify objects in images.  
In this project, we use a pre-trained YOLO model (YOLOv3 or YOLOv5) to detect common objects like people, cars, animals, etc., in real-time images or videos.

## üöÄ How to View or Run This Project

### ‚úÖ Option 1: Run on Google Colab (Easy)
1. Click on the notebook: [`yolo_object_detection.ipynb`](./yolo_object_detection.ipynb)
2. Open with **Google Colab**
3. Click **"Runtime > Run all"** to execute all code cells
4. Upload test images (if required) and see the detections live in the notebook

### ‚úÖ Option 2: Run Locally
1. Clone this repo and open the notebook in Jupyter or VS Code.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python torch torchvision
   git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5  # For YOLOv5


3.Follow instructions in the notebook to detect objects.

What YOLO Does
Loads pre-trained model

Accepts input image or video

Predicts:

Class of object

Confidence score

Bounding box location

Displays the result with bounding boxes and labels

üñºÔ∏è Sample Results
(Add your result images here if available)
Example: Detected person, car, dog in an uploaded image

üìö Learning Outcomes
